50		50		300		Jerky frequently, went off course
50		50		100		Slight waves, small amplitutde but high frequency, completed the course
50		100		100		High jerking, sharp turns, high frequency, quickly went off course
50		25		100		Completed course, high jerking, started off wavy
50		40		100		Completed course and turny course, slight jerking, a little wavy

75		40		100		High jerking, normal frequency, got off course quickly
75		20		100		Low frequency waves, slight jerking, got off course almost near the end/middle
75		20		150		Low frequency waves, light jerking, got off course around 8, stayed straight longer
75		40		150		Jerky, got off course halfway throughish
75		40		200		Jerky, oscillations increased until it got off course halfway through
75		80		200		Super jerky, got off course almost immediently
75		50		200		Jerky, high frequency, got off course halfway
75		30		200		Jerky, increased amplitude adn frequency as it drove, got off course halfway throguh

Serial prints were all removed
75		30		150		Completes the straight path well but not the curved one
75		30		130		Still great on the straight path, but the curved one still doesn't make it to the second curve, oscillates less so improved over previous test case
75		30		100		Same as above
75		20		100		Smoother but still would get off track as soon as second turn started
75		20		200		Same as above :/
75		20		200		Started from other side of track and it still got off on the bad turn
75		20		100		Works p well on both tracks, still gets off on that one part of the track, not sure if that's the track problem or a car problem

65		40		100		Worked on the whole track! :) But, it was wavy the whole time (use slow inner wheel code)

75		40		150		Works on the track with the slow inner wheel code! Sometimes doesn't stop
